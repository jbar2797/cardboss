# Product Requirements Document: CardBoss

## 1. Overview
CardBoss is a web platform that guides Pokémon card investors by ranking the top 100 cards based on quantitative buy/hold/sell signals derived from advanced mathematical models, machine learning, and sentiment analysis. The platform targets collectors and investors seeking data-driven insights.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide transparent investment signals for Pokémon cards.
- Update rankings daily using real-time market and sentiment data.
- Deliver an intuitive interface for browsing cards, trends, and analytics.
- Support future expansion to additional collectibles and premium features.

## 3. User Personas
1. **Casual Collector** – wants quick guidance on which cards to buy or sell.
2. **Active Investor** – compares detailed metrics, tracks portfolios, and sets alerts.
3. **Analyst/Researcher** – explores raw data, models, and historical performance.

## 4. User Stories
- As a user, I can view a ranked list of the top 100 investable cards with buy/hold/sell tags.
- As a user, I can filter rankings by set, era, condition, and other card attributes.
- As a user, I can inspect a card detail page with price history, model scores, and sentiment trends.
- As a user, I can create an account to save watchlists and receive notifications (phase 2).
- As an admin, I can manage data sources, model configurations, and user roles.

## 5. Functional Requirements
### 5.1 Data Acquisition
- Ingest price data from marketplaces (TCGplayer, eBay, etc.).
- Collect card metadata and population reports.
- Stream sentiment data from social media, forums, and news APIs.

### 5.2 Data Pipeline & Storage
- Scheduled ETL jobs normalize and store data in a relational database.
- Feature engineering produces model inputs (returns, volatility, sentiment scores, liquidity).
- Historical datasets are versioned for reproducibility.

### 5.3 Modeling & Signal Generation
- Time-series forecasting and ML models estimate expected return and risk.
- NLP pipeline computes sentiment scores per card.
- Ensemble framework converts model outputs into buy/hold/sell signals.

### 5.4 Ranking & API
- Service ranks cards daily based on risk-adjusted expected returns.
- RESTful API exposes ranking data, card details, and model metrics.

### 5.5 Web Application
- Responsive UI lists top 100 cards with filters and search.
- Card pages show charts, sentiment, and signal history.
- Authentication and premium features (watchlists, alerts) implemented in later phases.

### 5.6 Analytics & Reporting
- Track model accuracy and user engagement metrics.
- Export reports for historical performance and user portfolios.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle growing data volume and concurrent users.
- **Reliability**: Daily ranking updates with minimal downtime.
- **Security**: Protect user data, enforce authentication and role-based access.
- **Performance**: API responses <300ms for ranking endpoint, <1s for card detail pages.
- **Maintainability**: Modular architecture with automated testing and CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Assumptions & Dependencies
- Access to third-party APIs for price and sentiment data.
- Availability of historical card datasets for backtesting.
- Cloud infrastructure for hosting and data storage.

## 8. Milestones
1. **MVP (3 months)**: Basic data pipeline, ranking algorithm, and public top-100 web page.
2. **Phase 2 (6 months)**: Advanced ML models, sentiment analysis, user accounts, watchlists.
3. **Phase 3 (9+ months)**: Premium features, alerts, portfolio analytics, scalability improvements.

## 9. Metrics of Success
- Accuracy of buy/hold/sell signals versus market outcomes.
- Growth in daily active users and subscriber conversions.
- System uptime and API response times.

## 10. Open Questions
- Which additional marketplaces or data partners will be onboarded?
- What premium pricing tiers and feature sets will resonate with users?
- How will regulatory considerations affect investment advice features?
