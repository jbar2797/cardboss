# Project Outline: CardBoss

## 1. Goal
Build a web platform that ranks the top 100 Pok√©mon cards to invest in based on quantitative buy/hold/sell signals derived from advanced mathematical models, machine learning, and sentiment analysis.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Data Acquisition
- Price history and current listings from sources such as TCGplayer, eBay, and other marketplaces.
- Card metadata (set, rarity, condition, population reports).
- Sentiment data from social media, forums, and news.

### 2.2 Data Pipeline
- Ingest raw data through scheduled jobs and APIs.
- Clean and normalize datasets.
- Store data in a relational database.
- Feature engineering for model inputs (returns, volatility, liquidity, scarcity metrics, sentiment scores).

### 2.3 Modeling & Analytics
- Time-series forecasting to estimate future prices and volatility.
- Machine learning models to predict expected returns and risk.
- Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques.
- Ensemble framework that produces a unified investment signal for each card.

### 2.4 Scoring & Ranking
- Convert model outputs into buy/hold/sell signals.
- Rank cards based on risk-adjusted expected returns.
- Maintain a top-100 list with configurable filters (set, era, condition).

### 2.5 Web Application
- Backend API serving card rankings, charts, and metadata.
- Frontend UI displaying the top 100 cards with interactive charts and filters.
- Authentication for premium features (watchlists, alerts).

### 2.6 Infrastructure & DevOps
- Containerized services with Docker.
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Hosting on cloud provider (AWS or similar) with managed database.

### 2.7 Project Management
- Agile iterations with defined milestones:
  1. Prototype data pipeline and basic ranking algorithm.
  2. MVP website showing dynamic top-100 list.
  3. Integrate advanced ML models and sentiment analysis.
  4. Launch premium features and scaling.

## 3. Team Roles
- **Quantitative Research**: develop algorithms and statistical models.
- **Data Engineering**: build data ingestion and storage infrastructure.
- **Machine Learning**: implement training pipelines and sentiment analysis.
- **Web Development**: create backend APIs and frontend interface.
- **DevOps**: manage CI/CD and deployment.

## 4. Success Metrics
- Accuracy of buy/hold/sell signals compared to market outcomes.
- User engagement and retention.
- Expansion of data sources and card coverage.
